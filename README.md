### Test statistical assignment for Data Analysis 3 (2020)

This is a test statistical assignment for the Data Analysis 3 class at the University of Exeter (2020). This test assignment will not count towards your final mark. The purpose of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to test the Github and Github Classroom submission procedures.

Once you have accepted an invitation to this assignment, Github Classroom will create your personal copy of this repository. Your task is to complete the code in the testAssignment.Rmd document, knit it with R Markdown in the specified format and produce a markdown file (.md) with the output. Then you want to stage, commit and push both files (.Rmd and .md) to your personal assignment repository on Github.

After this you want to login on Bart as usual and submit a Word document that only contains a URL of your personal repository with a completed assignment. This step is necessary so that your submission is registered in Bart and I can enter marks directly into the system.

Please see this video to make sure you understand the process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTsfBAV7sOo (the video does not explain how to submit on Bart, but I expect you to know this).

The deadline for this test assignment is Tuesday 28 January at 2pm. Please do not commit after the deadline. You will be able to do this, but I will not check any commits made after 2pm (each commit on Github has a timestamp).

If you have any questions about this assignment the best way to ask them is by raising an issue on Github in the main assignment repository. You may want to tag me (@abessudnov) when raising your issue to make sure that I receive a notification about it. Before raising your issue please check that it hasn't been addressed already.
